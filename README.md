# Top Fiera

For this traineship assignment I was asked to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) using:

- Angular

- Typescript

- Preferably Reactive programming using the powerful RxJS library

Top Fiera is an application that allows the user to browse through the videos, tracks and albums provided by the Top40 API

# Must haves

The application should:

- Be responsive and work for both a small mobile screen and a large desktop browser screen

- Show the content from the provided API in an attractive and intuitive way
 
- Currently the API supports Youtube for the music media. Show a player for it
 
- The data of the API can be filtered on date using additional parameters. It is expected you to create UI elements to be able to filter on date (year and week)
 
- Create a navigation menu and structure to switch between the 4 types of lists the API supports
 
- Beautiful styling and animation is highly expected to create a fun, interactive and above all, attractive application. The design and layout is up to you but we     want to see as much of the information the API provides back in your application and presented in an attractive way
 
- As the data for a list is quite big to show in one long list UI for pagination is highly encouraged
